Build a personality prediction system using Python that can analyze a CV (Curriculum Vitae) or resume (in PDF or text format) and predict Big Five personality traits: 
- Openness
- Conscientiousness
- Extroversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

The system should work in the following pipeline:

1. **CV Preprocessing:**
   - Accept CVs in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format.
   - Use OCR (via OpenCV and Tesseract) if the CV is an image or scanned PDF.
   - Convert and extract all textual content.

2. **Text Cleaning and NLP Preprocessing:**
   - Remove stopwords, punctuation, numbers.
   - Tokenize, lemmatize/stem words.
   - Extract sections such as:
     - Education
     - Experience
     - Skills
     - Projects
     - Certifications

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Use NLP techniques to convert text to numerical features:
     - TF-IDF vectors
     - Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT embeddings)
   - Optionally: use linguistic features (e.g., LIWC-style cues)

4. **Sentiment and Linguistic Analysis:**
   - Perform sentiment analysis on descriptive parts.
   - Capture linguistic indicators (e.g., use of assertive vs. collaborative language).

5. **Personality Prediction Model:**
   - Train or use a pre-trained ML/DL model (Random Forest, SVM, or a deep learning classifier like BiLSTM or transformer-based models).
   - Map patterns in text to Big Five traits.
   - Output a score (0 to 1 or % confidence) for each personality trait.

6. **Optional Reinforcement Learning Use:**
   - Use Deep Reinforcement Learning to improve predictions iteratively based on feedback loops from user/job matching scores or historical hiring outcomes.

7. **Output:**
   - Display predicted personality scores with visualization (bar chart or radar chart).
   - Print a short personality summary like:
     - “This candidate is likely to be highly conscientious and agreeable with moderate extroversion.”
   - Save results in a JSON or CSV file.

8. **Technology Stack:**
   - Python 3.x
   - OpenCV (for image/PDF handling)
   - `pytesseract` (OCR)
   - `nltk`, `spaCy`, `transformers`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
   - Optional: PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning models

9. **What to Learn / Deliverables:**
   - Learn end-to-end NLP project flow
   - Use advanced language models and feature engineering
   - Deliver `personality_predictor.py` with a demo CV and results
   - Include README.md with instructions

This should be an intelligent system capable of extracting personality indicators from professional documents and presenting them in a meaningful, interpretable format.
